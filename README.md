# TicTacToeBasicPythonPFun
Tic Tac Toe game in Python 
As a part of our Semester 1 Project of Programming Fundamentals course, we created a basic TicTacToe game in Python. This game does NOT involve any GUI and is purely based on basic python without the use of any external libraries.
You can go through the Project Report to learn more about the game and how it works.
